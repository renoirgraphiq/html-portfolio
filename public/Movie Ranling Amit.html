<h1>The best Movies According to Amit </h1>

<h2>Adipurush</h2>
<p>Let’s say you want to watch “Adipurush,” a new Indian mythological action-fantasy, without thinking so much about what came before it. You want to enter the theater with as little baggage as possible, despite the associations that come with the marquee-topping Prabhas, star of both S.S. Rajamouli’s trend-setting “Baahubali” period action fantasies.</p> 
<h2>The Royal Hotel</h2>
<p>In her debut narrative film, the workplace horror “The Assistant,” writer/director Kitty Green took the most ordinary setting and made it a tense, nauseating psychological thriller.</p>
<h2>Surprised by Oxford</h2>
<p>Both the book and the movie “Surprised by Oxford” take their title from C.S. Lewis’ Christian apologetical Surprised by Joy. Like Lewis, Carolyn (Caro) Weber is a skeptic-turned-believer, and the memoir and film are based on her experience at Oxford, where she attended a college 400 years older than the United States of America.</p>
